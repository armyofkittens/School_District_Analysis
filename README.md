# School District Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The original analysis was to find how school spending, school size, and school type affects the overall math and reading scores for a sample of 15 schools in a district. It was later discovered however, that Thomas High School (THS) may have altered their ninth grade math and reading scores. The new analysis was to find how removing those scores from the data pool impacts the district's metrics. 

## Results of Analysis
* The  scores did go down in the district summary, however impact to the overall district were negligable.

* While the other schools weren't impacted in the per school summary as expected, reduction to the math and reading scores for THS were also negligable.

</p>

* Since THS has a higher spend range, removing the ninth grade math and reading scores caused an overal passing increase for lower spending schools and reduction for higher spending schools.

* Removal of THS math and reading scores caused a small increase to schools in the medium to small range, and a small decrease to schools in the large range.
