# School District Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The original analysis was to find how school spending, school size, and school type affects the overall math and reading scores for a sample of 15 schools in a district. It was later discovered however, that Thomas High School (THS) may have altered their ninth grade math and reading scores. The new analysis was to find how removing those scores from the data pool impacts the district's metrics. 

## Results of Analysis
* The  scores did go down in the district summary, however impact to the overall district was negligable.

</p>

* While the other schools weren't impacted in the per school summary as expected, reduction to the math and reading scores for THS were also negligable.

* Removal of the ninth grade math and reading scores did not change THS' rank in the top 5 schools in the district.

* Removal of the ninth grade math and reading scores for THS only impacted scores for the ninth grade, as expected.

</p>

* Since THS has a higher spend range, removing the ninth grade math and reading scores caused an overal passing increase for lower spending schools and reduction for higher spending schools.

## Summary
While the change in data caused a small impact to the overall district and the individual school performance, it did not cause a rank reduction for THS in the top five schools in the district. It caused a small skew in data for lower spending schools, with no impact to the scores by school type or school size. After reworking the analysis, it is clear that removal of ninth grade math and reading scores for THS did not cause a large impact.
